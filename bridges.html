     The Danyang–Kunshan Grand Bridge (simplified Chinese: 丹昆特大桥; traditional Chinese: 丹昆特大橋; pinyin: Dān-Kūn tèdà qiáo) is a 164.8-kilometre-long (102.4 mi) viaduct on the Beijing–Shanghai High-Speed Railway.[2] It is the longest bridge in the world.[3]
    </p>
<h3>
     Bridge
    </h3>
<p>
     The bridge is located on the rail line between Shanghai and Nanjing in Jiangsu province. It is in the Yangtze River Delta, where the geography is characterized by lowland rice paddies, canals, rivers, and lakes. The bridge runs roughly parallel to the Yangtze River, about 8 to 80 km (5 to 50 mi) south of the river. It passes through the northern edges of population centers (from west to east) beginning in Danyang, Changzhou, Wuxi, Suzhou, and ending in Kunshan. There is a 9-kilometre long (5.6 mi) section over open water across Yangcheng Lake in Suzhou.[1]
    </p>
<h3>
     Designer
    </h3>
<p>
     The China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC), a subsidiary of China Communications Construction Company designed and built the bridge. It is a Chinese government-funded company which was originally part of the Foreign Aid Office of the Ministry of Communications of China. This company leads major civil engineering projects in China like highways, railways, bridges, ports, and tunnels.[5]

     The Huajiang Canyon Bridge (Chinese: 花江峡谷大桥), is a suspension bridge under construction in Guizhou province, China. The bridge crosses the Beipan River as it passes through the deep Huajiang Canyon. Upon completion, it will be the world's highest bridge, measuring 625 metres (2,051 ft) from the bridge deck to the bottom of the gorge. It will surpass the current highest bridge, the Duge Bridge, which crosses the same river 200 kilometres (120 mi) upstream. The bridge is expected to be open in June 2025.
    </p>
<h3>
     Project
    </h3>
<p>
     Among the reasons for the construction of the bridge were: the revitalization of a very rural region, and the promotion of tourism, with the projected creation of a center for extreme sports at the bottom of the canyon. The canyon crossing time, which is currently 70 minutes, will be reduced to just over one minute.
    </p>
<h3>
     Construction
    </h3>
<p>
     The construction began in 2022. In April 2023, the first tower of the suspended part reached 199 metres (653 ft) in height and the construction of the upper transverse beam has begun.
    </p>
<p>
     The inauguration is planned for 2025.

     The Duge Bridge ([tú.kɤ̌]), also called the Beipanjiang Bridge, is a four-lane cable-stayed bridge on the border between the provinces of Guizhou and Yunnan in China.It spans the deep gorge of the Nizhu River (a tributary of the Beipan), near the town of Duge.
    </p>
<p>
     As of 2021, the bridge is the highest in the world, with the road deck sitting over 565 metres (1,854 ft) above the floor of the gorge.The bridge is part of the G56 Hangzhou–Ruili Expressway between Qujing and Liupanshui. The eastern tower measures 269 m (883 ft), making it one of the tallest in the world, although it is 74 m (243 ft) shorter than the 2004 Millau Viaduct's tallest pier.
    </p>
<h3>
     Construction
    </h3>
<p>
     Construction began in 2011. The bridge was completed on 10 September 2016, and was opened to the public on 29 December 2016. It cost a total of ¥1.023 billion and took five years to build. It was recognized by Guinness World Records as the world's highest bridge in 2018.

     The Arkadiko Bridge or Kazarma Bridge is a Mycenaean bridge near the modern road from Tiryns to Epidauros in Argolis on the Peloponnese, Greece. The stone crossing, which is dated to the Greek Bronze Age, is one of the oldest crossable arch bridges still in existence. It is the oldest preserved bridge in Europe
    </p>
<p>
     The corbel arch bridge was constructed during the Mycenaean Period in a typical Cyclopean style contemporary to the Late Helladic period (III) (ca. 1300-1190 BC). The bridge, which is 22 m (72 ft) long, 5.60 m (18.4 ft) wide at the base and 4 m (13 ft) high, spans a 1 m (3 ft 3 in) culvert. The width of the roadway is about 2.50 metres (8 ft 2 in).
    </p>
<p>
     Arkadiko Bridge was part of a military highway between the two cities of Tiryns to Epidauros which formed part of a wider Hellenic road network. The sophisticated layout of the bridge and the alignment of the road indicate that the bridge could be used by chariots. Three thousand years later, the bridge remains in local use.
